A simple and intuitive excel/ods file to help you plotting two-way interactions.

Fill in the values as requested from a multiple linear regression table.

You just need the BETA coefficients of the intercept, the IV, the moderator and the interaction effect, and the mean and the standard deviation of both the IV and the moderator.

The Y axis is not scaled but you could just leave it as it is or change the scale, or just opt for no-scale

The Y axis and the graph titles must be entered manually

all othe labels are generated from the values you insert in the green cells.


Then you are done
